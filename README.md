CSSCMS - CSS `Content Management System`

A declarative approach to generating HTML GUIs for editing CSS properties.

All major css types have been tested with parsing (see the demo css for examples of test inputs). There are a few edge cases that might require manual updating, but the parser does quite well with very large css declarations, across most all types (media queries, keyframes, imports, etc...)
